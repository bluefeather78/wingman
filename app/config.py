# ---------- /api/messages (Gemini-backed) ----------
# Interactive, in-page AI calls from script.js's callGemini() — ranking, profile chat,
# tracker extraction, etc. Pinned to gemini-3.5-flash-lite: cheaper/faster than
# gemini_common.MODEL ("gemini-3.6-flash", used by the offline batch scripts
# check_deadlines.py/check_reviews.py/scrape_opportunities.py), which matters here since
# these calls block a real page interaction instead of running unattended. Revisit
# alongside gemini_common.MODEL — see that module's docstring on model ID churn.
# NOTE: "gemini-3.6-flash-lite" (as literally requested) does not exist in the Gemini API —
# there is no lite variant of the 3.6 generation yet (confirmed via ListModels against the
# live key on 2026-08-18). Pinned to gemini-3.5-flash-lite instead, the closest existing
# lite model, following the same "pin an exact version" convention as gemini_common.py's
# MODEL constant. Swap this if/when a real gemini-3.6-flash-lite ships.
MESSAGES_MODEL = "gemini-3.5-flash-lite"
# Uniform cap across every /api/messages call site (mirrors the old Anthropic path's
# uniform max_tokens=1000) — bumped above what each system prompt's own "stay well
# within a 1000-token response" instruction asks for, to leave headroom for Gemini 3.x's
# thinking tokens, which draw from this SAME budget (see gemini_common.py's "FOURTH
# finding" docstring — at max_tokens=700 there, thinking alone consumed 673 of it).
MESSAGES_MAX_TOKENS = 2000

# ---------- /api/messages-claude (Anthropic-backed, profile chat only) ----------
# profileChatNextQuestion/profileChatStarterQuestionsFromAI (script.js's callClaude())
# deliberately stayed on Claude rather than moving to Gemini with the rest of the app on
# 2026-08-18 — a separate endpoint from /api/messages so the Gemini path above is
# untouched; client still sends the same plain {system, userContent, useWebSearch} body,
# translated into Anthropic's content-block/messages shape here rather than on the client.

# Default for the short profile-chat questions this endpoint was built for. Callers that
# produce a long answer (profile synthesis rewrites the WHOLE profile every merge, so its
# output grows with the profile) send their own "maxTokens" and are clamped to the ceiling
# below rather than to this. At the flat 1000 the synthesized profile was silently cut off
# mid-sentence once a student's story got past a few paragraphs — Anthropic returns the
# partial text with stop_reason "max_tokens", so it looked like a complete answer.

# ---------- Opportunities catalog (Supabase-backed) ----------
# The opportunity catalog lives in a Supabase (hosted Postgres) table rather than
# the old static opportunities.json — see migrate_to_supabase.py for the one-time
# migration and CLAUDE.md for the rationale (scalability + free tier vs local SQLite).
# The anon key is safe to hold server-side here: it's rate-limited by Supabase and

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_ANON_KEY", "")
# `status` is check_deadlines.py's running/not_running/unknown verdict. It ships so the
# finder can drop discontinued programs from the results — it is NULL on 1195 of the
# 1239 active rows (never deadline-checked), so any consumer must treat NULL as "no
# verdict", never as "not running".

# ---------- Signup consent & eligibility policy ----------
# The Terms of Use (legal/terms.md §2) restrict Wingman to users 13 or older, and
# require a parent/guardian's permission for anyone under 18. Registration collects
# three acknowledgements and refuses the account without them; what was agreed to is
# stamped onto the user row (see create_user) so it can be audited later.
#
# TERMS_VERSION is what gets recorded per account. It is the effective date printed at
# the top of both documents — bump it whenever legal/*.md changes materially, so rows
# accepted under the old text are distinguishable from rows accepted under the new.
TERMS_VERSION = "2026-08-22"

# ---------- Persistent user account database (Supabase-backed) ----------
# Account records live in a Supabase `users` table rather than the old flat
# users_db.json file — see migrate_users_to_supabase.py for the one-time
# migration. Unlike the opportunities table, this table has NO RLS policies at
# all, so the anon key gets zero access; every request here uses the
# service_role key, which bypasses RLS. That key must never be sent to the
# browser — it's only ever used from this server process.
# passwordHash arrives already SHA-256-hashed client-side; the server never
# sees or stores a plaintext password.
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY", "")

# ---------- Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow) ----------
# Client ID/Secret from a Google Cloud OAuth client (Web application type), configured with
# redirect URIs for both localhost and the production domain. Server-side redirect flow, not
# Google Identity Services JS — the callback exchanges a code for tokens itself, so no
# client-side Google library is needed. See google_auth_schema.sql for the users table columns
# this depends on (google_id, and password_hash made nullable for Google-only accounts).

# ---------- Google Calendar sync ----------
# A separate, additional OAuth grant from Google Sign-In above: sign-in only ever asks for
# "openid email profile", so an existing signed-in session (password or Google) has no
# token that can touch Calendar. Connecting Calendar is its own start/callback pair that
# requests the calendar.events scope against the already-known userid, and persists the
# resulting tokens (see google_calendar_schema.sql) rather than discarding them like the
# short-lived _google_session_tokens above — a sync can then run again later without
# re-prompting, as long as the refresh token stays valid.

# ---------- On-demand, shared/cached deadline check (Claude Haiku-backed) ----------
# Replaces check_deadlines.py's batch/cron model as the primary way status/deadlines data
# gets populated: rather than proactively scanning the whole catalog on a schedule (which,
# on 2026-08-18, burned through Gemini's daily grounding quota partway through a single
# full pass), a check now only runs when a real user actually adds an opportunity to their
# tracker, or loads the Tracker page with an already-tracked item whose cached data has
# gone stale. Uses Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) with web search enforced.
# See check_deadlines.py's docstring for the underlying Supabase columns
# (status/important_dates/was_estimated/important_date_note/last_checked_at) — this endpoint
# reads/writes the exact same columns, so the two mechanisms share one cache. important_dates
# holds EVERY pertinent date for the opportunity (registration opens/closes, event start/end,
# notifications, etc.), each tagged with a "type" — not just a single narrow "deadline"; see
# check_deadlines.py's build_system() for the full schema. The batch script still exists for
# bulk backfill/cleanup (e.g. after a big scrape), but is no longer the primary way this data
# gets kept current — see the plan doc's "On-demand deadline checking" section for the full
# rationale.
GEMINI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY", "")  # Kept for other uses; not used for deadline checking


# A deliberately permissive shape check — enough to reject junk and to guarantee the
# value is safe to put in a PostgREST `eq.` filter (no commas, quotes, or parens, which
# are that syntax's separators). Not an attempt to validate deliverability; the real
# proof an address works is mail arriving at it.

# ---------- Session auth (Phase 2 — PLAN_2_auth.md) ----------
# Identity is carried in a signed JWT, never in the request body — that is what closes
# the pre-migration IDOR on /api/data/*. Two-token model:
#   * a short-lived ACCESS token, verified statelessly on every gated request (no DB hit);
#   * a longer-lived REFRESH token, presented only to /api/auth/refresh, where the
#     account's `token_version` is checked against the DB. Bumping users.token_version
#     invalidates every outstanding refresh token ("log out everywhere" / account kill),
#     so all sessions die within one access-token lifetime.
# JWT_SECRET signs both. If it is unset the auth layer fails closed (see app/auth/tokens.py)
# rather than signing with a guessable key. Set it in .env locally and as a Render env var
# (render.yaml lists it sync:false); never commit it or send it to any client.

# ---------- User metrics: the activation funnel, retention, and the daily snapshot ----------
# The Cost per user tab measures dollars out. This measures usage and revenue in. They
# share the `users` roster and cross-link, but they stay separate views: one is a spend
# ledger, the other a product funnel, and a page that computes both computes neither well.
#
# Two migrations gate the time-series half (see the .sql files for why each exists):
#   user_activity_schema.sql       -> DAU/WAU/MAU, retention, "came back after signup day"
#   user_metrics_daily_schema.sql  -> trend lines for state metrics, which are otherwise
#                                     unrecoverable (the `data` jsonb holds one profile,
#                                     not a history of one)
# Neither is required for the funnel, plan mix, conversion or the roster. Those come from
# the `users` table as it stands today, which is why they shipped first.
